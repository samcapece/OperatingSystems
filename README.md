# Operating Systems
## Project Compilation

This repository contains four distinct projects developed as part of the operating systems course. Each project focuses on different aspects of operating systems, from process management and inter-process communication to multithreading and socket programming.

### Project 1: Merkle Tree Implementation
- **Description**: Implements a Merkle Tree for efficient data verification using cryptographic hashes.
- **Key Features**:
  - Parallel tree construction using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`.
  - Cryptographic hash functions for data integrity.

### Project 2: Data Deduplication
- **Description**: Focuses on optimizing storage efficiency by eliminating duplicate data within a filesystem.
- **Key Features**:
  - Hierarchical process management.
  - File hashing and symbolic links for deduplication.

### Project 3: Parallel Image Processing
- **Description**: Uses multithreading to accelerate the image rotation process.
- **Key Features**:
  - Thread pool and shared request queue.
  - Synchronization with mutexes and condition variables.

### Project 4: Client-Server Image Processing
- **Description**: Develops a client-server model for image processing tasks using socket programming.
- **Key Features**:
  - Multi-threaded server handling multiple clients.
  - TCP socket communication and image processing tasks.


## Repository Structure
Each project folder contains source files, a Makefile for building the projects, and a specific README detailing the project objectives, setup instructions, and usage guide.

### Contributions
Each project was completed as part of a group assignment with 3 members. I took the lead role in all 4 projects.

### Additional Information
Refer to individual `README.md` files within each project directory for more detailed information about project setup, compilation, and usage instructions.
